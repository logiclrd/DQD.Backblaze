The Backblaze Agent (client) for .NET Core is an implementation of the [Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage API](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html). Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage provides the cheapest cloud storage available on the internet. Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage is Â¼ of the price of other storage providers. Give it a try as the first 10 GB of storage is free.

## Features

 - Full support for Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage API v2 including files, accounts, keys and buckets.
 - Built targeting .NET Standard 2.0 which means Backblaze Agent will work on Windows, Mac and Linux systems.
 - Seamlessly intergrates with .NET Core Dependency Injection and HttpClientFactory to implement resilient requests.
 - Simple in-memory response cache using MemoryCache.
 - Large file support with low memory allocation and IProgress status.
 - Native support of task based programming model (async/await).

## Divergence

This library was originally being developed as [microcompiler.backblaze](https://github.com/microcompiler/backblaze), but that development effort appears to have been abandoned and the team members seem to be unreachable. If they resume activity in the future and merge my changes upstream, then I intend to shutter this fork. Until then, this fork allows me to proceed with my development efforts with another project that consumes this library.

## Installation via .NET CLI

To install DQD.Backblaze.Agent run the following command:

```bash
> dotnet add package DQD.Backblaze.Agent
```

## Getting Started

*Work in Progress!* Whilst we encourage users to play with the samples and test programs, this project has not yet reached a stable state.

You will need an **key_id** and an **application_key** to configure Backblaze Agent. You can obtain these from the [Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) portal. See the [Sample Project](https://github.com/logiclrd/DQD.Backblaze/tree/main/samples ) for an example of how to use this packages.

### Adding Backblaze Agent to Services

```CSharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddBackblazeAgent(options =>
    {
    options.KeyId = "[key_id]";
    options.ApplicationKey = "[application_key]";
    });
}
```

To get a list of backblaze buckets simply inject `IStorageClient` into your class and call the async client.  

```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
  private readonly IStorageClient _storage;

  public IndexModel(IStorageClient storage)
  {
      _storage = storage;
  }

  [BindProperty]
  public IEnumerable<BucketItem> Buckets { get; private set; }

  public async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync()
  {
    Buckets = await _storage.Buckets.GetAsync();

    if (Buckets == null)
    {
      return NotFound();
    }

    return Page();
  }
}
```

### Initializing Backblaze Client without Dependency Injection

Install the following packages:

```bash
> dotnet add package Backblaze.Client
> dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory
> dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Debug
```

Sample Code:

```csharp

class Program
{
  private static IStorageClient Client;

  static async Task Main(string[] args)
  {
    try
    {
      var options = new ClientOptions();

      var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>
      {
        builder
          .AddFilter("Bytewizer.Backblaze", LogLevel.Trace)
          .AddDebug();
      });

      var cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());

      Client = new BackblazeClient(options, loggerFactory, cache);  
      await Client.ConnectAsync("[key_id]", "[application_key]");

      var buckets = await Client.Buckets.GetAsync();

      foreach (var bucket in buckets)
        Console.WriteLine($"Bucket Name: {bucket.BucketName} - Type: {bucket.BucketType}");   
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
      Console.Error.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
  }
}
```

### Initializing Backblaze Client without Dependency Injection, Logging or Caching

Install the following package:

```bash
> dotnet add package Backblaze.Client
```

Sample Code:

```csharp
class Program
{
  private static IStorageClient Client;

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    try
    {
      Client = new BackblazeClient();
      Client.Connect("[key_id]", "[application_key]");

      var buckets = Client.Buckets.GetAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();

      foreach (var bucket in buckets)
        Console.WriteLine($"Bucket Name: {bucket.BucketName} - Type: {bucket.BucketType}");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
      Console.Error.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
  }
}
```

## Basic Usage

Upload File Stream

```csharp
foreach (var filePath in Directory.GetFiles(@"c:\my\directory"))
{
  using (var stream = File.OpenRead(filePath))
  {
    var results = await Client.UploadAsync("[BucketId]", new FileInfo(filePath).Name, stream);
  }
}
```

Download File Stream

```csharp
var files = new string[] { @"c:\my\directory\file1.txt", "file2.bat" };

foreach (var fileName in files)
{
  using (var stream = File.Create(fileName))
  {
      var results = await Client.DownloadAsync("[BucketName]", fileName, stream);
  }
}
```

## Microsoft Logging Integration

Install the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging packages:

```bash
> dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Debug
```

Tracing to the Debug window can be enabled with the following code:

```csharp
services.AddLogging(builder =>
{
    builder.AddDebug();
    builder.AddFilter("Bytewizer.Backblaze", LogLevel.Trace);
});
```

## Agent Options

```csharp
services.AddBackblazeAgent(options =>
{
  options.KeyId = "[key_id]";
  options.ApplicationKey = "[application_key]";
});
```

The following table describes the [Agent Options](https://github.com/logiclrd/DQD.Backblaze/blob/main/src/Client/Client/IClientOptions.cs) available:

| Option Name | Default | Description |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| KeyId  | --- | **Required** - The key identifier used to authenticate. |
| ApplicationKey | --- | **Required** - The secret part of the key used to authenticate. |
| HandlerLifetime | 600 | The time in seconds that the message handler instance can be reused. |
| Timeout | 600 | The time in seconds to wait before the client request times out. |
| RetryCount | 5 | The number of times the client will retry failed requests before timing out. |
| RequestMaxParallel | 10 | The maximum number of parallel request connections established. |
| DownloadMaxParallel | 5 | The maximum number of parallel download connections established. |
| DownloadCutoffSize | 100MB | Download cutoff size for switching to chunked parts in bytes. |
| DownloadPartSize | 100MB | Download part size of chunked parts in bytes. |
| UploadMaxParallel | 3 | The maximum number of parallel upload connections established. |
| UploadCutoffSize | 100MB | Upload cutoff size for switching to chunked parts in bytes. |
| UploadPartSize | 100MB | Upload part size of chunked parts in bytes. |
| AutoSetPartSize  | false | Use the recommended part size returned by the Backblaze service. |
| ChecksumDisabled  | false | This is for testing use only and not recomended for production environments. |
| TestMode  | --- | This is for testing use only and not recomended for production environments. |

### Test Mode Options

```csharp
services.AddBackblazeAgent(options =>
{
  // This is for testing use only and not recomended for production environments.
  options.TestMode = "fail_some_uploads";  
});
```

The following test mode options are available to verify that your code correctly handles error conditions.

| Option String | Description |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fail_some_uploads| Random uploads fail or become rejected by the service. |
| expire_some_account_authorization_tokens | Random account authorization tokens expire. |
| force_cap_exceeded |Cap exceeded conditions are forced. |

## Integration Tests

You will need an **key_id** and an **application_key** to configure Backblaze Test Agent [settings.json](https://github.com/logiclrd/DQD.Backblaze/blob/main/test/Integration/settings.json) file.
